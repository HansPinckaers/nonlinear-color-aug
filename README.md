# nonlinear-color-aug
We often use linear color transformation (like most implementations of contrast, brightness jitter). These transformations are potentially quickly learned by a neural network, especially networks with normalization layers. This repository implements non-linear color augmentations (like gamma-correction and the S-curves in Photoshop).
